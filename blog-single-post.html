                One of the keys to reaching your goals is to eliminate any escape routes. It is tempting to retreat to
                safety and comfort when challenges and difficulties arise. To avoid turning around and abandoning your
                goals, you must make going forward more compelling then going back.

                When striving towards a goal, you must focus on what you want to obtain and avoid the impulse to go back to
                what you know and to what is comfortable. When Spanish Conquistador Hernando Cortez landed in Mexico, one of
                his first orders to his men was to burn the ships. Cortez was committed to his mission and did not want to
                allow himself or his men the option of going back to Spain. By removing this option, Cortez and his men were
                forced to focus on how they could make the mission successful.

                Eliminating an escape route creates a compelling reason to focus on the goal and to keep moving forward.
                However, it is important to keep in mind that although Cortez had his men burn the ships, he did not have
                them burn the food and supplies. Cutting off an escape route to
